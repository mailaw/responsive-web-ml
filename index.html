      Anemone is the dreamy psych-pop brainchild of Chloé Soldevila, a
      classically-trained, jazz-fluent performer from Montreal. Ironically for
      an album recorded in the dead of a harsh Canadian winter, their debut Beat
      My Distance resembles the aural equivalent of a beach-town postcard, its
      airy shoegaze atmosphere drifting in and out at a leisurely tide. That
      calming, sun-dappled backdrop, in turn, helps Soldevila’s sweet,
      simplistic hooks ripen to perfection: organic alchemy at its finest. Such
      is Soldevila’s goal with the LP, a clearly-stated one at that; on the
      early-half, Slowdive-esque highlight “Daffodils,” she proclaims, “Where
      you go, I want to be a hole inside your head.” And judging by the sound of
      Beat My Distance, this promising upstarts gets what she wants, without
      fail.
